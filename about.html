<h1>About Me</h1>

<body>
<img src="images/Me.jpg">

<p>My name is Erik Strauss. I am a student at Northern Arizona University studying Applied Computer Science. I'm from California, but I decided to go to school in Arizona. I have been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. I someday hope to be a game developer, preferably for <a href="http://us.battle.net/en/">Blizzard Entertainment</a>.</p>

<p>I'm working on this site throughout this semester as part of CS 212. It will slowly get better as the semester progresses. I'm making the site about my Dad's Dixieland Jazz Band because he wants me to eventually take over his site. I figured I might as well practice with this site before trying to make a professional looking one.</p>
