	<p>The Yosemite Jazz Band first started in October of 1993 in Oakhurst, California, near the beautiful Yosemite National Park. Berl Howell first approached Ted Strauss (a great reed player) and Jim Kirin (a great percussionist) about starting a traditional jazz band. Soon, other musicians in the Oakhurst community joined the band and in the summer of 1994, they performed at the Oakhurst Pizza Factory. It quickly became an annual tradition and now they perform there every summer.</p>

	<p>The roster for the band has changed throughout the years, but the current roster includes Berl Howell, Ted Strauss, Jim Kirin, Pat Mierkey, Jeff Gurule, James Mierky, Jennifer Piccolotti, and David Quinday.</p>
